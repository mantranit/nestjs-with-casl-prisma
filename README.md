## Description

A simple backend REST API using NestJS, CASL, Prisma, PostgreSQL and Swagger.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## DB setup

Start a PostgreSQL database with docker using:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

- If you have a local instance of PostgreSQL running, you can skip this step. In this case, you will need to change the `DATABASE_URL` inside the `.env` file with a valid [PostgreSQL connection string](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/postgresql#connection-details) for your database.

Apply database migrations:

```bash
$ npx prisma migrate dev
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Swagger end point

/api-docs

## CASL example

```js
@Get()
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, PoliciesGuard)
@CheckPolicies((ability: AppAbility) => ability.can(Action.Read, 'User'))
@ApiBearerAuth()
@ApiOkResponse({ type: UserEntity, isArray: true })
async findAll() {
  const users = await this.usersService.findAll();
  return users.map((user) => new UserEntity(user));
}
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
